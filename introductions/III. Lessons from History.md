If you want to be sure that your program works, you have two options: you
either use Haskell or you do extensive testing. This sections presents a list
of real-world disasters which were caused by programmer errors so simple that
they could have been easily detected by most statis analysers (or would have
never occured if Haskell would have been used).

Fortunately, programmers have learnt from past mistakes: The Jet Propulsion
Laboratory's Coding Style Guide [<sup>[ref]</sup>](http://lars-lab.jpl.nasa.gov/JPL_Coding_Standard_C.pdf)
mandates the use of a static analyser.

Hopefully, future rockets will blow up
for serious reasons, like sensors mounted upside down
