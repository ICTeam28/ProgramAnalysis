Static and dynamic analysis are two radically different forms of program
analysis. Static analysis is performed by inspecting the source code
of the program without running it, whilst dynamic analysis is performed during
the runtime. Ideally, a well-tested program would use both static
and dynamic analysis for verification.

In certain scenarios, one of the mentioned methods might be impractical.
Static analysis employs complex algorithms, so running using it on large
and complex programs might be inefficient. On the other hand, setting up a
suitable test environment for dynamic analysis might also be difficult.
