Summary: An introduction on why Static Analysis is so cool!

This is an example post demonstrating how to write new content and summaries.

Some things to remember:
 * Use cool markdown features.
 * You can *emphasise* things if you like.
 * But the main structuring is left to the layout program of the static site
generator.

Don't forget all the vital meta-data at the top of the page.
