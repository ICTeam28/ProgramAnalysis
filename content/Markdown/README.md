Write your summaries in markdown format and save them in this directory.
Create subdirectories to group similar posts if needed.

Remember to include all references and links to sources.

Put pictures in the images directory and use relative links to include them.

I will work on a layout and use a static site generator (probably Pelican) to
turn all the summaries into one website. :)
