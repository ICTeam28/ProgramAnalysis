Create the Webpages in this git repository.

1.Accessing it from the Web:

Your entire group project directory is accessible via the web as the URL:

        http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/project/2013/163/g13163xx/

Note: we usually recommend that you put web pages in a subdirectory
of your project directory, for example

/vol/project/2013/163/g13163xx/web/

in which case the above URL would become:

        http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/project/2013/163/g12163xx/web/

You may also want to add a very restrictive .htaccess file to the top
level directory to disallow web browsing of your entire group project
directory.
