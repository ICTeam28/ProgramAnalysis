Summary: Comparison between static and dynamic analysis


Static and Dynamic analysis developed side by side in different communities and
have been regarded as distinct disciplines. Furthermore, the domains in which
one of them shines represent the nightmare for the other. [@Ref]

Static Analysis inspects program code, and strives to conclude all possible
outcomes of program execution. The most common static analyses are compiler
optimisations. Static analysis is sound and conservative, which guarantees the
correctness of its conclusions. In other words, "Static analysis never makes
mistakes". Its conservatism reflects in making weaker, easier to establish,
statements that are guaranteed to be true and thus preserve soundness.
Therefore, the analysis output may not be precise enough to be useful. For
instance, for some function g, the statement "g returns a number" is weaker than
the statement "g returns an even number".

In contrast, conclusions of dynamic analysis are based on executing a program,
and observing its behaviour during the runtime. Testing and profiling are
standard dynamic analysis. Dynamic analysis is precise and exact because it
does not require any abstractions or estimations. It deterministically answers
questions about computed values, memory consumption or the length of the execution.
Dynamic Analysis is quick to perform, and can take as little time as program
execution.

Although, some static analyses are performed quickly, generally, obtaining
precise results demands many complicated and time consuming computations.
Furthermore, certain problems, such as pointers analysis, are almost unsolvable.
Conversely, the same problem is solved at runtime, using a single machine cycle
to compare the pointers.

The results of dynamic analysis cannot be generalised to future executions.
Furthermore, there is no guarantee that the set of test cases, over which the
program was run, covers all possible executions of the program. One of the main
challenges of dynamic analysis is constructing a test suit, which covers all
representative cases, and thus reveals properties of the program. Despite the
fact that unsound dynamic analysis often faces criticism, it is used on many
occasions because it delivers a sufficient quantity of valuable information.

Since both of the analyses collect different information, performing one
analysis, then the other is more powerful than performing either one on its own.
Static and dynamic analysis can supplement each other by providing, otherwise
unavailable, information. For instance, static analysis can reduce the
collection of data by guaranteeing that a smaller amount of information is
sufficient, which makes dynamic analysis quicker and more efficient.

Traditionally, static and dynamic analysis have been viewed as distinct
approaches with different techniques. However, static and dynamic analysis can
interact by enhancing each other, and blending the strengths of both approaches.
