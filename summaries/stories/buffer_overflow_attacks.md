Summary: Buffer Overflow Attacks


Buffer overflow is an extremely common bug.
First major exploit was 1988 Internet worm,
often called the Morris worm. It was written
by a student, Robert Tapan Morris, and affected
approximately 6000 computers.[@Commission] Furthermore,
it resulted in the first conviction in the US under 1986
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.[@Wiki]

Buffer overflow occurs when more data than holding area can
handle is put into it. Furthermore, it often leads to total
compromise of the host.


Consider the following C function:[@Boneh]

    void func(char* str) {
	  char buf[128];

	  strcpy(buf, str);
	  do-something(buf)
    }


When the function is called the stack looks like:

![overflow_before](images/overflow_before.JPG)

However if str\* is 136 bytes long, after *strcpy*,
the stack looks like:

![overflow_after](images/overflow_after.JPG)

This is caused by the lack of bounds checking
in *strcpy* function.


Some of the unsafe C library functions include:

+ strcpy(char \*dest, const char \*src)
+ strcap(char \*dest, const char \*src)
+ gets(char \*s)


The main problems is that these functions have no range checking.
One of the possible ways to guard against buffer
overflows is to run Static source code analysis.
