Summary: Patriot Missile System


Patriot Missile system was a surface-to-air system used by the United States army,
originally designed to protect against Soviet cruise missiles and medium to high attitude
aircrafts. During the Gulf War in the early 1990's it was used in the Operation Desert Storm
as a part of the Patriot missile air defence system. Patriot battalions were placed in
strategic positions in order to defend military personnel and citizens against Scud missiles
launched by Iraqi forces.[@Lum]



Patriots weapon control computer operates in several stages:
1. Based on information such as velocity, longitude and latitude system searches for objects with Scud missile characteristics on its radar.
2. The missile is tracked by the system as it approaches and a range gate calculates an area in the air where the system should look next for the incoming missile.
3. Once the incoming missile is in range, the Patriot system launches one of its own missiles.
